2- boolean conditions


selecting columns:
1- series for single column
2- dataframe for multiple columns

series = df["Column name"]
dataframe = df[["Column1","Column2","..."]]

filtering rows:
- boolean indexing

#based on a single condition:
filtered_rows = df[df["Salary"]>50000]

#combine multiple conditions
filtered_rows = df[(df["Salary]>50000) & (df["Salary]<80000)]
